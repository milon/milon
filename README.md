### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Milon.

Birth, childhood everything was in [Dhaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka), [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh). Got education from Shamsul Haque Khan High School and Dhaka College. Then went to Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University to study Information and Communication Technology.

I have interest in every single thing on the earth except formal education. Loved to be in touch with computer and technology. Had a weakness on computer programming. Recently very excited with cars.

I love to hang out with my buddies. I used to go to [Koratkol University](https://www.facebook.com/koratkol/) regularly, the best hangout place on earth. Unfortunately, I can't do it any more because I moved out from Bangladesh.

Currently, I am working for [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.com/) as a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer and living in Berlin, Germany. I am also an admin of [phpXperts](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pxperts/), the largest developer community of Bangladesh.

I am the father of beautiful prince and princess.

I am a proud Bangladeshi ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©.
