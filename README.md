### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Milon.

Birth, childhood everything was in [Dhaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka), [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh). Got an education from Shamsul Haque Khan High School and Dhaka College. Then went to Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University to study Information and Communication Technology.

I have an interest in every single thing on the earth except formal education. Loved to be in touch with computers and technology. Had a weakness in computer programming. Recently very excited with cars.

I love to hang out with my buddies. I used to go to [Koratkol University](https://www.facebook.com/koratkol/) regularly, the best hangout place on earth. Unfortunately, I can't do it anymore because I moved out of Bangladesh.

Currently, I am working for [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as a Software Development Engineer II and living in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I am also an admin of [phpXperts](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pxperts/), the largest developer community in Bangladesh.

I am the father of a beautiful prince and princess.

I am a proud Bangladeshi ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©.
